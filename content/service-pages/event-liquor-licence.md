Examples:

### Licensed Venues
Some venues (hotels, restaurants, established event venues) hold permanent licences. Check if:

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Event Liquor Licence FAQs**

#### How far in advance should I apply?
Minimum 21-30 days, but we recommend 60-90 days to avoid any complications or rush fees.

#### Can I get an event licence with only 1 week notice?
Possibly with fast-track processing and additional fees, but it's risky. Contact us immediately if you have an urgent need.

Yes, you can specify which alcohol types your licence covers. Some clients choose beer and wine only to simplify service.

#### What if my event gets rained out and I need to reschedule?
Contact the issuing authority immediately. Some provinces allow date changes, others require new applications. We assist with this.

#### Can one licence cover multiple venues for one event?
Each venue typically needs separate licence or specific multi-venue approval. We handle complex multi-site events.

The festival organizer's event licence typically covers all vendors, but specific arrangements vary. We advise on vendor licensing.
