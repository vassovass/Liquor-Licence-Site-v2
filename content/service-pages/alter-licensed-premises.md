## What is Section 53?

### Heading (H2)
**Understanding Licensed Premises Alteration Requirements**

Section 53 of the Liquor Act requires licence holders to obtain **prior consent from the Liquor Licencing Authority** before making any alterations to licensed premises.

This applies to:
- Structural alterations or renovations
- Extensions or additions to the building
- Changes to the licensed area (bar, retail floor, seating)
- Layout modifications
- Changes to access or egress
- Addition of outdoor seating or trading areas
- Moving the bar or service area

**You cannot proceed with alterations until consent is granted.** Unauthorized changes can jeopardize your licence.

Legal compliance demonstrates professionalism to customers, employees, and business partners.

## The Application Process

### Heading (H2)
**How to Get Section 53 Alteration Consent**

### Step 1: Planning Phase
Before you start any work, contact us. We assess your plans and identify all requirements.

### Step 2: Obtain Building Approval
Get municipal building plan approval first - this is usually required for Section 53 application.

### Step 3: Document Preparation
We prepare comprehensive floor plans, motivation letters, and all supporting documents.

### Step 4: Application Completion
We complete the official LA8 form (or provincial equivalent) with all alteration details.

### Step 5: Submission
We submit your application to the provincial Liquor Licencing Authority.

### Step 6: Authority Review
The authority reviews your proposed alterations for compliance with Liquor Act requirements.

### Step 7: Inspection (if required)
Some alterations require site inspection by liquor inspectors.

### Step 8: Approval Granted
Once approved, you receive written consent to proceed with alterations.

### Step 9: Post-Completion Inspection
After work is completed, final inspection confirms compliance with approved plans.

**Don't start renovations before approval** - it's illegal and risks your licence.

## Regularizing Unauthorized Alterations

### Heading (H2)
**What If Alterations Were Already Made Without Consent?**

Many licence holders discover previous owners made unauthorized alterations, or they weren't aware consent was required.

### The Problem
Unauthorized alterations are a violation that can:
- Block licence transfers
- Cause renewal issues
- Result in fines
- Lead to licence suspension

### The Solution
Apply retrospectively for Section 53 consent to regularize the alterations.

### Regularization Process
1. **Disclosure:** Acknowledge alterations and when they occurred
2. **Assessment:** We assess if alterations can be approved retroactively
3. **Documentation:** Prepare as-built plans showing current layout
4. **Application:** Apply for consent to regularize existing alterations
5. **Compliance:** Demonstrate current compliance with all regulations
6. **Resolution:** Authority grants consent or requires modifications

**Discovered unauthorized alterations when buying a business?** Don't complete the purchase until they're resolved. We assist buyers with due diligence and sellers with regularization.

## Compliance After Approval

### Heading (H2)

### Maintain Documentation
Keep copies of:
- Section 53 approval letter
- Approved floor plans
- Building completion certificates
- Final inspection reports

### Update Licence Certificate
Some provinces issue updated licence certificates showing the alterations.

### Ongoing Compliance
Altered premises must continue to meet:

## Working With Contractors

### Heading (H2)
**Coordinating Renovations and Legal Compliance**

### Inform Your Contractor
Ensure building contractors understand:
- Work cannot start until Section 53 is approved
- Must follow approved plans exactly
- Final inspection will be required

### Project Timeline
Factor Section 53 approval time into your renovation schedule:
1. Design phase (2-4 weeks)
2. Building plan approval (4-8 weeks)
3. Section 53 application and approval (4-8 weeks)
4. Construction phase
5. Final inspections and sign-off

**Plan 3-4 months minimum** from initial design to starting construction.

### Avoid Costly Mistakes
Contractors sometimes advise "no one will notice" or "apply later." This is illegal and jeopardizes your licence. **Always get consent first.**
