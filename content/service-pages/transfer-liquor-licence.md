## What is a Section 65 Liquor Licence Transfer?

### Heading (H2)
**Understanding Liquor Licence Transfers in Cape Town**

Section 65(1) of the Liquor Act governs the **transfer of liquor licences** from one person or entity to another. This applies when:

- Purchasing an existing business that holds a liquor licence
- Selling a licensed business (restaurant, pub, bottle store, etc.)
- Changing ownership structure of a licensed business
- Transferring a licence due to inheritance or other circumstances

The licence is tied to both the premises and the licence holder. When ownership changes, the licence must be formally transferred through the Liquor Licencing Authority to remain valid and legal.

**Important:** Operating with an un-transferred licence after a business sale is illegal and carries severe penalties including fines and business closure.

## Why Transfer a Liquor Licence?

### Heading (H2)
**The Value of an Existing Liquor Licence**

### Faster Than New Applications
Transferring an existing licence is significantly faster than applying for a new licence (Section 36), typically taking 30-60 days vs 90-120 days.

### Immediate Trading Capability
With Section 65(3) consent, you can start trading immediately while the transfer is being processed - no revenue loss during the transition.

### Established Trading History
An existing licence demonstrates the premises has been successfully operating under licence, reducing approval risks.

### Competitive Advantage
In areas with licence quotas or restrictions, an existing licence may be the only way to legally sell alcohol.

### Business Continuity
Customers and suppliers continue without disruption when the licence transfers smoothly.

## The Licence Transfer Process

### Heading (H2)
**How to Transfer a Liquor Licence in Cape Town**

### Step 1: Sale Agreement
The business sale must be documented in a formal sale agreement specifying the licence transfer.

### Step 2: Document Preparation
Both buyer and seller must provide comprehensive documentation (see requirements below).

### Step 3: Section 65(3) Application (Optional but Recommended)
Apply for temporary consent to trade while the full transfer is processed - this allows immediate business operation.

### Step 4: Transfer Application Submission
We submit the complete LA4 transfer application form to the provincial Liquor Licencing Authority.

### Step 5: Public Notice
Required public notices are published in local newspapers and at the premises.

### Step 6: Objection Period
A 30-day period allows for public objections. We monitor and respond to any objections raised.

### Step 7: Authority Processing
The Liquor Licencing Authority reviews and processes the transfer application.

### Step 8: Approval & Certificate
Once approved, the new licence certificate is issued in the new owner's name.
