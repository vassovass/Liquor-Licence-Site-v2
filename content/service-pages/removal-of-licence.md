## Introduction

Relocating your licensed business to new premises? You can take your liquor licence with you through a removal application under Section 66(2) of the South African Liquor Act.

We relocate licences for Cape Town CBD restaurants moving to the Atlantic Seaboard, Bellville bottle stores expanding to Somerset West, and Stellenbosch tasting rooms upgrading their venues so every liquor license in Cape Town travels with the business.

With over 20 years of experience, **Beverly Jeursen** ensures your licence removal application is approved efficiently, allowing you to relocate your business without losing your valuable liquor licence.

Many moves also involve structural work or interim trading. We coordinate [Alter Licensed Premises in Cape Town](/services/alter-licensed-premises) submissions for build-outs and secure [Consent to Conduct Business in Cape Town](/services/consent-conduct-business) so the new team can operate legally while the removal is pending.

## What is Section 66(2)?

### Heading (H2)
**Understanding Liquor Licence Removal in Cape Town**

Section 66(2) allows a licence holder to **remove (relocate) their liquor licence from one premises to another**. This enables you to move your business location while maintaining the same licence.

This applies when:
- Relocating your restaurant, pub, or bottle store to new premises
- Expanding to larger premises
- Moving to better location
- Lease expires and you're moving to new property
- Your current premises becomes unavailable

**Important:** This is different from:
- **Section 65 Transfer:** Where ownership changes
- **New Application (Section 36):** Applying for completely new licence
- **Section 53 Alteration:** Changes to existing premises

Section 66(2) keeps your licence but moves it to new physical location.
