**Consent to Conduct Business in Cape Town Pending Licence Transfer - Section 65(3)**

---

## Introduction

Buying a licensed business but can't afford months of no revenue while the licence transfer is processed? Section 65(3) of the South African Liquor Act provides the solution.

We obtain **consent to conduct business in Cape Town** so Long Street bars, Stellenbosch tasting rooms, and Bellville bottle stores can keep trading legally while the Section 65(1) transfer finalises. This keeps your liquor license in Cape Town active and compliant during the ownership change.

With over 20 years of experience, **Beverly Jeursen** secures Section 65(3) consent allowing you to legally operate the licensed business **immediately** while the full Section 65(1) licence transfer is being processed.

Every consent packet travels with a full [Transfer of Liquor Licence in Cape Town](/services/transfer-liquor-licence) application, and when buyers need to reconfigure the venue we coordinate [Alter Licensed Premises in Cape Town](/services/alter-licensed-premises) or [Store Liquor Applications in Cape Town](/services/store-liquor-application) so ongoing upgrades stay compliant.

## What is Section 65(3)?

### Heading (H2)
**Understanding Temporary Trading Consent in Cape Town**

Section 65(3) provides for an application for **temporary consent to conduct the licensed business** while the full licence transfer (Section 65(1)) is being processed.

### The Problem It Solves
Standard licence transfers (Section 65(1)) take 30-90 days. During this period:
- Business cannot legally trade (sell/serve alcohol)
- Revenue is lost
- Staff may need to be laid off
- Customers go elsewhere
- Suppliers lose orders
- Business viability is threatened

### The Solution
Section 65(3) consent allows the new owner to **start trading immediately** (typically within 7-14 days) while waiting for the full transfer to be completed.

## Section 65(3) vs Section 65(1)

### Heading (H2)
**How Temporary Consent Relates to Full Transfer in Cape Town**

### Section 65(1) - Full Licence Transfer
- Complete transfer of licence from seller to buyer
- Takes 30-90 days
- All due diligence and vetting
- New licence certificate issued
- Permanent solution

[Link to Full Transfer Service: /services/transfer-liquor-licence]

### Section 65(3) - Temporary Consent
- Temporary permission to trade while transfer processes
- Takes 7-14 days typically
- Based on transfer application being filed
- Allows immediate revenue generation
- Expires when Section 65(1) is approved

### Critical Relationship
Section 65(3) **must be applied for simultaneously with Section 65(1)**. You cannot get temporary consent without also pursuing the full transfer.

Think of it as: *Section 65(1) is the journey, Section 65(3) is the bridge you cross while making that journey.*

## The Application Process

### Heading (H2)
**How to Get Section 65(3) Consent**

### Step 1: Business Sale Agreement
Formal agreement between buyer and seller documenting the sale.

### Step 2: Transfer Application (Section 65(1))
File full licence transfer application - 65(3) cannot be applied for alone.

### Step 3: Simultaneous 65(3) Application
File Section 65(3) consent application at the same time as transfer.

### Step 4: Insurance Secured
Obtain comprehensive insurance before consent can be granted.

### Step 5: Document Submission
All buyer, seller, and premises documentation submitted together.

### Step 6: Authority Review
Liquor Licencing Authority reviews consent application (faster review than full transfer).

### Step 7: Consent Granted
Temporary consent issued, typically within 7-14 days.

### Step 8: Begin Trading
New owner can legally operate business from consent grant date.

### Step 9: Full Transfer Continues
While trading under 65(3), the Section 65(1) transfer continues processing.

### Step 10: Final Approval
When 65(1) is approved, new licence certificate issued and 65(3) expires (no longer needed).

**Speed is critical** - we file both applications immediately to get you trading fast.
