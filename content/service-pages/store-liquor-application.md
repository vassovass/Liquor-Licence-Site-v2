## Introduction

Need additional storage space for your liquor stock? Want to store alcohol at a location separate from your licensed premises? You need approval under Section 57(1) of the South African Liquor Act.

We arrange Section 57 approvals for Cape Town bottle stores, Stellenbosch wine farms, Paarden Eiland warehouses, and Montague Gardens distributors so their **liquor licenses in Cape Town** stay compliant while stock sits offsite.

With over 20 years of experience, **Beverly Jeursen** ensures your liquor storage application is approved legally and efficiently, allowing you to expand your storage capacity compliantly.

When storage upgrades accompany venue moves or renovations, we coordinate complementary filings like the [Removal of Licence in Cape Town](/services/removal-of-licence) or [Alter Licensed Premises in Cape Town](/services/alter-licensed-premises) so every square meter remains compliant.

## What is Section 57(1)?

### Heading (H2)
**Understanding Liquor Storage Permits in Cape Town**

Section 57(1) governs applications for permission to **store liquor at a location other than the licensed premises**. 

Under the Liquor Act, your liquor licence authorizes you to store alcohol only at your licensed premises. If you need to store stock elsewhere - whether a warehouse, storage facility, or secondary location - you must obtain Section 57(1) approval.

### When You Need Section 57(1)

- Insufficient storage space at licensed premises
- Seasonal stock build-up (wine farms, tourism businesses)
- Bulk purchasing requiring warehouse storage
- Multiple locations under one licence
- Stock security at dedicated facility
- Temperature-controlled storage requirements
- Business expansion with offsite logistics

**Storing liquor without approval is illegal** and can result in stock confiscation, fines, and licence complications.

### Multiple Premises Licence
Some provinces allow one licence covering multiple trading premises.

- Not just storage, but trading locations
- Restaurant chains, bottle store groups

### When to Use Section 57
- Storage only, no public trading
- Warehouse/logistics function
- Supporting single licensed trading location

**We advise which approach suits your business model.**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Heading (H2)
**Section 57(1) Storage Permit FAQs**

#### Can I store liquor in a self-storage unit?
Generally not suitable due to security and access control requirements. Dedicated commercial warehouse is preferred.

#### Do I need insurance for stored liquor?
Yes, comprehensive insurance covering both the storage premises and liquor stock is typically required.

#### Can I store liquor at my home?
Unlikely to be approved due to security and zoning requirements. Commercial premises are expected.

#### How often can I move stock to/from storage?
As often as your business requires, but all movements must be logged and recorded.

#### Can I share storage with another licensed business?
Each business needs separate Section 57 approval for the same location. Shared warehouse is possible but separately approved.

#### What happens if my stock is stolen from approved storage?
You must report to police and Liquor Licencing Authority. Proper security and insurance protect your interests.

#### How long is Section 57 approval valid?
Typically ongoing while your primary licence is in force, subject to annual compliance.
