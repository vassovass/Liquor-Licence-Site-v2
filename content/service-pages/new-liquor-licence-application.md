## What is a Section 36 Liquor Licence?

### Heading (H2)
**Understanding Section 36 Liquor Licence Applications**

Section 36 of the South African Liquor Act governs applications for **new liquor licences**. This applies when you're:

- Opening a brand new business that will sell or serve alcohol
- Starting a restaurant, pub, bar, or tavern
- Opening a bottle store, liquor store, or off-consumption outlet
- Establishing a hotel, guest house, or accommodation with liquor service
- Setting up a club or members-only venue serving alcohol
- Any new business requiring the legal right to sell liquor

This is different from transferring an existing licence (Section 65) or temporary licences (Section 48). A Section 36 application creates a completely new licence for your premises.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Heading (H2)
**New Liquor Licence Application FAQs**

#### Can a foreigner apply for a liquor licence in South Africa?
Yes, foreign nationals can apply if they have a valid work permit and meet all other requirements. The process is more complex, which is why professional assistance is particularly valuable.

#### Can I start trading while my application is being processed?
No. You must have an approved liquor licence before you can legally sell or serve alcohol. Trading without a licence carries severe penalties.

#### What if my application is rejected?
You have the right to appeal the decision. We assist with appeals and can often identify and rectify the issues leading to rejection.

#### Do I need a liquor licence to serve wine at my restaurant?
Yes. Any business serving alcohol to customers, even just wine with meals, requires a liquor licence.

#### How often does a liquor licence need to be renewed?
Liquor licences are typically valid indefinitely but require annual fee payments. We can assist with renewals and ongoing compliance.

#### What's the difference between a new application and a transfer?
A new application (Section 36) creates a brand new licence for premises that don't currently have one. A transfer (Section 65) moves an existing licence from one owner to another.
