## 1. Understanding South African Liquor Legislation

### National vs Provincial Legislation

South Africa has a dual system of liquor legislation:

**National Liquor Act (Act 59 of 2003):** Governs liquor at the national level, covering manufacturing, distribution, and retail sale.

**Provincial Liquor Acts:** Each province has its own liquor legislation governing retail licences:
- Western Cape Liquor Act
- Gauteng Liquor Act
- KwaZulu-Natal Liquor Licensing Act
- And so on for all 9 provinces

This means specific requirements can vary by province, which is why local expertise is crucial.

### Why Liquor Licences Are Strictly Regulated

South Africa regulates liquor sales to:
- Protect public health and safety
- Control alcohol availability to minors
- Manage social impacts of alcohol consumption
- Generate tax revenue
- Ensure responsible business practices
- Balance economic benefits with community concerns

Understanding this regulatory framework helps you appreciate why the application process is thorough and why compliance is strictly enforced.
